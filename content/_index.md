# Welcome!

Welcome to the site hosting runbooks for alerts shipped with
[ks-prometheus](https://github.com/kubesphere/ks-prometheus) project.

## Reason

ks-prometheus (extended from [kube-prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus)) was always meant to provide the complete monitoring solution for KubeSphere environments. The project
already includes a lot of various components to fullfill this goal and one crucial part is including alerting rules.
However what good are those alerting rules when one don't know what to do when the alert fires?

## Goal

We aim to ship meaningful runbook for every alert in ks-prometheus project and provide enough insight to help
KubeSphere users during incidents.

## How to contribute?

If you find any issues with current runbooks, please use the `Edit this page` link at the bottom of the runbook page.

For adding a new runbook please follow [add runbook](/docs/add-runbook) guide.

If you find any other issues, please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/kubesphere/alert-runbooks/issues/new)
or ask questions in [KubeSphere slack channel](https://kubesphere.slack.com/).
